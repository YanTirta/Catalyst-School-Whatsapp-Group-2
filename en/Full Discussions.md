FOLLOW UP DITMAWA

Regarding the application for community legalization, it cannot be done in the near future, waiting for the rector's regulation on new student organizations. The application for community legalization goes through an audit process by the Directorate General of Student Affairs, so it will be assessed whether it is feasible or not based on the direction of the community's vision &amp; mission, management structure (from advisors to divisions), work programs, community sustainability towards related industries, and suitability of the vision &amp; mission with UGM. Mr. Hempri offered to temporarily join the UGM entrepreneur community first, because it is considered to be still in the scope of finance and entrepreneurship. Mr. Hempri offered an open discussion with the entrepreneur community.

Yesterday, our colleagues at UCC received similar feedback from UGM's Student Affairs Directorate (Ditmawa). It seems the Ditmawa management is unfamiliar with crypto.
